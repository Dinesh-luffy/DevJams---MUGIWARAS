                                                           ORDER
This petition is presented by one of the brothers of Mr.S.Ranganath, who is said to be afflicted with
schizophrenia. By this petition, the petitioner seeks appointment as the guardian of the person and
manager of the properties of Mr.S.Ranganath. In addition, permission is requested for the sale of
1/7th share of Mr.S.Ranganath in the property described in schedule-D to the petition and for the
deposit of the sale proceeds thereof, including the utilization of the interest from such deposit.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
2. The petitioner states that his brother, Mr.S.Ranganath, is afflicted with schizophrenia. All the
siblings of the petitioner are arrayed as respondents in this petition. The petitioner states that his
father, Mr.N.Subba Reddy, died on 26.03.1990. It is stated that the properties described in schedule
A, B, C and D are the self-acquired properties of the petitioner's father, late Mr.N.Subba Reddy.
Consequently, upon his demise on 26.03.1990, right, title and interest in the said properties
devolved upon his seven children. The petitioner and his siblings intend to sell schedule D property
and have identified the buyer in respect thereof. Since the petitioner's brother, Mr.S.Ranganath, has
1/7th share in the schedule-D property, permission is sought for the sale of the said 1/7th share and
for dealing with the proceeds thereof.
3. In order to establish the petitioner's entitlement, evidence was recorded. Dr.N.M.Meena,
Assistant Professor at Kilpauk Institute of Mental Health, Kilpauk, Chennai-600 010, was examined
as PW1. In course of the examination of PW1, she deposed that Mr.S.Ranganath is afflicted by
schizophrenia. Consequently, PW1 stated that he is not in a position to take
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis decisions and requires assistance. The petitioner was examined as
PW2. In course of the examination-in-chief of PW2, the 28 documents which are set out at the foot
of this order, were exhibited as Exs.P1 to P28. These documents include the death certificate of late
N.Subba Reddy (Ex.P24), the death certificate of the petitioner's mother, S.Santha Bai (Ex.P26), the
joint consent affidavit of Respondents 1 to 6 (Ex.P28) and the title and revenue records relating to
schedule A to D properties (Exs.P2 to P22).
4. In response to a question as to the applicability of the Mental Healthcare Act 2017 (the Mental
Healthcare Act), learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the said Act does not provide for
the appointment of a guardian of the property of a mentally-ill person. As regards the National Trust
for Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple DisabilitiesS.Ramji vs Mrs.G.Banumathi on 8 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153813765/ 2Act, 1999 (Act 44 of 1999), he submitted that the said Act deals with mental retardation but not with
mental illness, such as schizophrenia. On examining the definition of mental illness under Section 2
(s) of the Mental Healthcare Act, it is clear that the definition of mental illness therein is wide but
excludes mental retardation. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Mental retardation is defined in
Section 2(g) of Act 44 of 1999 as a condition of arrested or incomplete development of the mind of a
person, which is specially characterized by sub-normality of intelligence. As correctly submitted by
learned counsel for the petitioner, schizophrenia is not a form of mental retardation although it
qualifies as mental illness. In any event, the powers of this Court under clause 17 of the letters patent
are wide and may be exercised, in appropriate cases, notwithstanding the enactment of statutes such
as the Mental Healthcare Act.
5. The assertions in the petition have been duly proved by adducing evidence. All the siblings of the
petitioner arrayed as respondents. They have filed consent affidavits and agreed to the appointment
of the petitioner as guardian of the person and property of Mr. S.Ranganath. In these circumstances,
the petitioner is entitled to succeed.
6. Accordingly, O.P.No.527 of 2022 is allowed on the following terms:
(i) by appointing Mr.S.Ramji as the guardian of the person and as
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis manager of the properties described in the
schedule A to D as regards the mentally-ill person, Mr.S.Ranganath;
(ii) permission is granted for sale of the 1/7th share of Mr.S.Ranganath in the
property described in Schedule D to the petition; and
(iii) the sale proceeds from the sale of the property, as regards the 1/7th share of
Mr.S.Ranganath, shall be deposited in an interest bearing fixed deposit account in a
nationalised bank. Such deposit shall be for an initial term of five years. The
petitioner is permitted to utilize only the interest accruals from such fixed deposit for
the welfare of Mr.S.Ranganath.
