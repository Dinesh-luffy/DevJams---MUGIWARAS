                     made by the 2nd Respondent against the Petitioner.
                                        For Petitioner     : Mr.G. Ethirajulu
                                        For Respondents : Mr. Yogesh Kannadasan

                                                           ORDER
This writ petition has been filed to quash the proceedings of the 1st Respondent in Na Ka No.3475
/B5/2022 dated 21.10.2022 and the complaint lodged by the 2nd Respondent to 1st Respondent
dated 12.10.2022 against the petitioner and consequently forbear the 1st Respondent from
continuing proceedings against the petitioner.
2. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the Petitioner that an enquiry notice under Section 77-A
of the Registration Act was issued by the 1st Respondent/District Registrar (Administration) to the
Petitioner to appear before him for enquiry on the basis of the complaint given by the 2 nd
Respondent. The learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner further submitted that the very
complainant is the brother of the Petitioner, his https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.No.33785/2022 of 2022 and M.P.No.33291 of 2022 complaint indicates that he is not claiming
any right over the property, but it is only questioned the manner in which the document is
registered and with regard to showing the boundaries.
3. Mr. Yogesh Kannadasan, Special Government Pleader takes notice for the 1st Respondent. It is
the submission of the learned Special Government pleader that according to the Respondent the
boundaries specified in the document is not in order, besides the Petitioner also misrepresented as if
there was a oral partition and registered the document.
Based on the above complainant notice has been issued for cancelling the document.
4. Learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner submitted that enquiry cannot be proceeded under
Section 77-A of the Registration Act for these type of cases. Only documents contrarily registered
under under Section 27- A and Section 22-B of the Registration Act can be cancelled under Section
77-A of the Act.
5. Section 22 B of the Act deals with refusal to register forged https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.No.33785/2022 of 2022 and M.P.No.33291 of 2022 documents and other documents
prohibited by law, which reads as follows:
"Section 22-B. Refusal to register forged documents and other documents prohibited
by law.— Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the registering officer shall
refuse to register the following documents, namely:— (1) forged document;N. Chinnasamy vs The District Registrar ... on 16 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151971207/ 2(2) document relating to transaction, which is prohibited by any Central Act or State
Act for the time being in force;
(3) document relating to transfer of immovable property by way of sale, gift, lease or
otherwise, which is attached permanently or provisionally by a competent authority
under any Central Act or State Act for the time being in force or any Court or
Tribunal;
(4) any other document as the State Government may, by notification, specify."
6. Thus, only the documents that fall within the ambit of forgery or any transaction which is
prohibited by any Central Act or State Act for the time being in force or any property which has
already been attached by a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.33785/2022 of 2022 and
M.P.No.33291 of 2022 competent authority, the Registering officer shall refuse to register. When
the sale has taken place those documents can be cancelled under Section 77- A of the Registration
(Tamil Nadu Second Amendment) Act, 2021.
7. Therefore, merely because someone has executed the document believing that the property
belongs to him that will not amount to forgery. It is relevant to rely on the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Mohammed Ibrahim Vs. State of Bihar reported in (2009) 8 SCC 751. In
paragraphs 14, 16 and 17 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:
"14. An analysis of Section 464 of the Penal Code shows that it divides false
documents into three categories:
1. The first is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently makes or executes a
document with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was
made or executed by some other person, or by the authority of some other person, by
whom or by whose authority he knows it was not made or executed.
2. The second is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or
otherwise, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.33785/2022 of 2022 and
M.P.No.33291 of 2022 alters a document in any material part, without lawful
authority, after it has been made or executed by either himself or any other person.
3. The third is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign,
execute or alter a document knowing that such person could not by reason of (a)
unsoundness of mind;
or (b) intoxication; or (c) deception practised upon him, know the contents of the document or the
nature of the alteration.
In short, a person is said to have made a “false document”, if (i) he made or executed a document
claiming to be someone else or authorised by someone else; or (ii) he altered or tampered aN. Chinnasamy vs The District Registrar ... on 16 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151971207/ 3document; or (iii) he obtained a document by practising deception, or from a person not in control
of his senses.
***
16. There is a fundamental difference between a person executing a sale deed claiming that the
property conveyed is his property, and a person executing a sale deed by impersonating the owner
or falsely claiming to be authorised or https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.33785/2022 of
2022 and M.P.No.33291 of 2022 empowered by the owner, to execute the deed on owner's behalf.
When a person executes a document conveying a property describing it as his, there are two
possibilities. The first is that he bona fide believes that the property actually belongs to him. The
second is that he may be dishonestly or fraudulently claiming it to be his even though he knows that
it is not his property. But to fall under first category of “false documents”, it is not sufficient that a
document has been made or executed dishonestly or fraudulently. There is a further requirement
that it should have been made with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was
made or executed by, or by the authority of a person, by whom or by whose authority he knows that
it was not made or executed.
17. When a document is executed by a person claiming a property which is not his, he is not claiming
that he is someone else nor is he claiming that he is authorised by someone else. Therefore,
execution of such document (purporting https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.33785/2022 of
2022 and M.P.No.33291 of 2022 to convey some property of which he is not the owner) is not
execution of a false document as defined under Section 464 of the Code. If what is executed is not a
false document, there is no forgery. If there is no forgery, then neither Section 467 nor Section 471 of
the Code are attracted."
8. Admittedly, in this case there is no case of forgery, as the petitioner himself executed the
document. Therefore, question of forgery does not arise at all. Every dispute between the joint
family members cannot be construed as forgery.
9. Considering the above, this Court is of the view that for every complaint the Revenue Authorities
cannot annull the documents, except the documents which are registered and fall within the ambit
of under Section 22-A and Section 22-B of the Registration Act. In respect of other documents, the
authorities have no role whatever to conduct the enquiry to cancel the document. Accordingly, the
impugned notice under Section 77-A https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.33785/2022 of 2022
and M.P.No.33291 of 2022 of the Registration Act dated 21.10.2022 is quashed.
10. In view of the above, the writ petition is partly allowed. No costs.
Consequently connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed. No costs.
