                                                               ORDER
These writ petitions are filed for a writ of mandamus directing respondents 1 and 2 to pay a sum of
Rs.50 lakh and Rs.60 lakh as compensation to the petitioners respectively and also for a direction to
respondents 1 and 2 to initiate appropriate proceeding as against respondents 3 to 8.
2.Since the relief sought for in these writ petitions arising out of a same case, these writ petitions are
taken up together and disposed of by this common order.
3.The learned Counsel for the petitioners submits that these petitioners were falsely implicated in a
criminal case registered in Crime No.90 of 2013 on the file of the Town Police Station, Paramakudi,
Ramanathapuram district, arrested, committed to prison and detained under the provisions of the
National Security Act. The petitioner in WP(MD)No.21495 of 2016, Raja Mohamed is a realtor by
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and 21496 of 2016 profession and his wife
was working as a Secondary Grade Teacher. The petitioner in WP(MD)No.21496 of 2016 is also a
realtor. One Murugan @ Murugesan, then town secretary of BJP party was murdered by three
unknown persons by throwing bombs on 19.03.2013. On the complaint of one Sivakumar, brother of
the deceased, the case in Crime No.90 of 2013 on the file of the Paramakudi Town Police Station was
registered as against three unknown persons under Sections 302 and 506(ii)IPC and under Section
5 of the Explosive Substances Act. The investigation was conducted by 6th respondent Ratna
Kumar, then Inspector of Police, Paramakudi Town Police Station. He arrested the petitioners that
they are the accused and remanded them to judicial custody. The petitioner V.N.Raja Mohamed was
arrested on 06.04.2013 and the petitioner Manoharan was arrested on 19.03.2013. They were also
committed to prison. On the recommendation of 6th respondent, the District Collector invoked the
National security Act on 01.05.2013 and on 04.05.2013 respectively as against the petitioners. Later
the investigation in Crime No.90 of 2013 was transferred to CBCID, headed by Additional
Superintendent of Police. The CBCID found that the real accused are one
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and 21496 of 2016 Fakhrudeen alias Police
Fakhrudeen, Bilal Malik, Mohammed Ismail @ Panna Ismail and also exonerated the petitioners in
the charge sheet filed on 06.4.2014. The Department has initiated departmental proceedings as
against 6th respondent Ratna Kumar and found him guilty. The 6th respondent under the pressure
of respondents 3 to 6 intentionally implicated the petitioners and forced them to accept the offence,
committed to prison from 19.03.2013 to 25.07.2013 and 06.04.2013 to 25.07.2013 respectively.
4.The learned Counsel further submits that respondents 1 and 2 have admitted that 6th respondent
did not conduct the investigation in Crime No.90 of 2013 properly and he conducted the
investigation in a casual manner, which resulted in false implication of the petitioners as accused,
for which they have initiated departmental preceding as against 6th respondent. In the
departmental proceedings he was found guilty and punishment of postponement of increment for
one year with cumulative effect was imposed. On the appeal filed by 6th respondent, the appellate
authority, the Director General of Police, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and
21496 of 2016 enhanced the punishment of postponement of next increment for two years with
cumulative effect. The review petition filed before the Director General of Police was rejected.V.N.Raja Mohamed vs The Secretary To The Government Of Tamil ... on 2 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186703360/ 45.The learned Counsel further submits that even after their release from the prison, the petitioners
faced several difficulties in the society, not only the petitioners, but even their families were affected
and they were ex-communicated from the society. Petitioner Raja Mohamed's wife was compelled to
resign her teacher job and the marriage fixed for his daughter was cancelled by citing the
registration of criminal case against him. Because of his false implication in this case, the petitioner
Manoharan's whole familly was viewed indifferently by the society, a stigma was cast upon them and
they were driven to leave their native place and the sufferings and the penuries experienced by them
cannot be described in words.

6.During the course of arguments the petitioner has also made endorsement with regard to the
respondents R3 to R5 that they are not pressing against them and accordingly they were removed
from this proceedings.
7.The sixth respondent took a stand that on the date of occurrence on 19.03.2013, he was at Chennai
on duty before the Advisory Board in respect of a case registered under Act 14 of 1982. The initial
investigation was conducted by one Pandian Inspector of Police attached to Paramakudi Town
station. He only prepared the inquest report, observation mahazar, rough sketch and he also
recorded the statement of witness 1 to 7. The 6th respondent took the charge of the investigation
from 21.03.2013 and examined 10 witnesses and he found that the father of the deceased namely
Kathiresan Chettiar inherited a property situated in Survey Nos.111/1 and 111/2 to an extent of
2.81.5 Hectares in Paramakudi. One Kurshid Banu, wife of Sheikh Mohammed filed a civil suit in
OS.No.144 of 2003 before the District Munsif, Paramakudi claiming 1.20 acre in the above said
land, on the instigation and hand in glove with the above said https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and 21496 of 2016 Raja Mohamed. The petitioner namely Manoharan is the
close relative to V.N.Raja Mohamed, who is a converted Muslim and his original name is
Rajapandian. The said Kurshid Banu hand in glove with the above said Raja Mohamed created a
forged sale deed in respect of 1.20 acre in the above said land belonging to Kathiresan Chettiar and
sold out the same to Manoharan. Some persons namely K.Sathaiyah, Karthigai Raja, Ramakrishnan,
Ramasamy, Karuppaiah and Muniyandi also colluded themselves for the above said forged acts.
Such being the situation the above said Kathiresen Chettiar and his son sold out above said entire
property to Raja Bhai @ Rafeek Raja of Melur, Madurai District for a sale consideration of Rs.8
Crores and 75 lakh. Before the above said sale consideration, the said V.N.Raja Mohamed and
Manoharan craeted problem to prevent the above said sale. Therefore the purchaser Raja Bhai @
Rafeek Raja mediated the said issue and paid a sum of Rs.80 lakh to the said VN.Raja Mohamed.
But even thereafter, V.N.Raja Mohammed demanded more money from the deceased and his father
Kathiresean Chittiar. In order to wreak vengeance due to the land dispte, V.N.Raja Mohamed and
his relative Manoharan with help of the goondas, murdered the above said

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186703360/ 58.Thereafter only 6th respondent nabbed the petitioner Manoharan on 06.04.2013 at 10.00a.m. On
his confession, he arrested 3rd and 4th accused namely Valakkai Rafeek and Sahul Hameed about
12.00p.m. and further arrested 1st accused V.N. Raja Mohamed on 06.04.2013 at about 2.45p.m
and produced all of them before the Judicial Magistrate, Paramakudi at about 6.40 p.m and they
were sent to judicial remand. Only after due concurrence and direction given by 3rd and 4th
respondents alone, he proceeded with the investigation, after informing each and every
development to them. In view of the depositions given by the defacto complainant and other
witnesses of the case in Crime No.90 of 2013 before the enquiry officer, still there is a chance of
including the writ petitioners and other accused again by filing appropriate application before the
appropriate Court of law to add them as accused in the above mentioned case. The brother of the
deceased namely Sivakumar, who was https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and
21496 of 2016 the defacto complainant in the above said case, deposed in the oral enquiry very
clearly by stating that only on the instigation of the CBCID (SIT) officials, he has given statement to
the effect that one Panna Ismail, Bilal Malik, Police Fakrudeen murdered his brother. Further the
said Sivakumar confirmed the identification of 3rd and 4th accused in this case during the
identification parade conducted before the Judicial Magistrate, Mudukulathur. Moreover, during his
examination, he was informed that one Aslam along with 4 other unidentified persons visited and
noticed area, where he runs the shop, on the previous day of the murder. Another witness PW4
namely Sathaiyah deposed that he had a nexus with V.N.Raja Mohamed and Manoharan in respect
of the disputed land and he received a sum of Rs.2 lakh from the above said V.N.Raja Mohamed.
Further two more witnsesses namely Rafeek Raja and father of the deceased namly Kathiresan also
deposed by supporting the same. From desposition of the above witnesses, it is very crystal clear
that the involvement of writ petitioners was confirmed in the above said crime. Further, the video
recording of the statement of the writ petitioners and PW4 Sathaiyah is available with him and he is
ready to produce https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and 21496 of 2016 the same
before this Court. However, the present investigation agency CBCID(SIT) discharged the writ
petitioners without any basis for the best reasons known to them. Therefore the claim of the
petitioners as they have not involved in the above said murder is ruled out. Mere filing of charge
sheet discharging the petitioners, does not mean a clean chit is given to them. Moreover since the
charge sheet filed before the Judicial Magistrate No.II, Ramanathapuram is pending adjudication
and therefore it cannot be construed as they have been falsely implicated in the above said case.
CBCID (SIT), who took up the investigation of the case in Crime No.90 of 2013 is not impleaded as
party as they are competent to give their reply to the present claim of the writ petitioners.
9.This Court considered the rival submissions and perused the materials placed on record.
10.One Murugan @ Murugesan, former Town Secretary of a political party was murdered on
19.03.2013 at about 15.00 hours in front of Ramu grocery shop, Eswaran kovil junction,
Paramakudi. On the complaint of one Sivakumar https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and 21496 of 2016 brother of the deceased the case in Crime No.90 of 2013 was
registered on the file of the Pramakudi Town Police Station for the offences punishable under
sections 302 and 506 (ii) IPC and under Section 5 of the Explosive Substances Act. Initially Pandian,
Inspector of Police, Paramakudi Town Police station took up the investigation, since the Inspector of
Police, Paramakudi Town Police Station was on official duty at Chennai. From 20.03.2013, 6thV.N.Raja Mohamed vs The Secretary To The Government Of Tamil ... on 2 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186703360/ 6respondent herein took up the investigation and continued the investigation in Crime No.90 of
2013. During his investigation it was recorded that the murder of Murugan @ Murugesan occurred
due to a land dispute between Kathiresan Chettiar (father of deceased) and Raja Mohamed of
Paramakudi. Kathiresan Chettiar, instead of selling his land to Raja Mohamed, sold it to Rafiq Raja
of Melur, who in turn sold it for double the amount within two months of his purchase. Therefore,
Raja Mohamed had an enmity over Kathiresan Chettiar for not selling the land to him. Therefore the
investigation officer 6th respondent arrested Manoharan and based on his confession one Vazhakkai
@ Rafiq Raja, Sahul Hameed and Raja Mohamed / petitioner herein were arrested on 06.04.2013.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and 21496 of 2016
11.During the investigation of a Murder of Vellore district Hindu front president Vellaiappan in
Vellore North PS.Crime No.599 of 2013, accused Fakrudeen @ police Fakrudeen, Bilal Malik and
Mohamed Ismail @ Panna Ismail were arrested by special investigation team of CBCID. During the
course of the investigation of Vellayappan's murder case, the accused Fakrudeen @ Police
Fakrudeen, Bilal Malik confessed their direct involvement in the murder of Murugan @ Murugesan,
Paramakudi as part of Jihad, as they felt the activities of Murugan @ Murugesan were anti-islamic.

Superintendent of Police CBCID. CBCID also enquired 6th respondent on 07.11.2013 in respect of
his investigation in Crime No.90 of 2013. 6th respondent has also admitted the same in his counter

Murugan @ Murugesan, was the then town secretary of a polictical party of Paramakudi Town. The

to a land dispute or due to religious motive. He also recorded that one Aslan - STPI member
converted sowrastra women to Muslim community and the deceased prevented the same and on
account of this also there was a motive. 6th respondent has taken up the investigation from

14.It is alleged that due to the pressure exerted by the higher officials, 6th respondent investigation
officer hastily fixed the petitioners as accused. One of the witnesses Sathaiya has deposed before the
trial court that he was coerced by 6th respondent to give statement implicating the petitioners as
accused. Kathiresan Chettiar, father of the deceased, in his evidence before
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and 21496 of 2016 the trial Court has stated
that he had never seen the investigation officer Ratna Kumar and he has talked to him only through
mobile. The department has also found that there was perfunctory investigation in the investigation
conducted by 6th respondent and proceedings were also initiated, enquiry was conducted and

Petitioner Raja Mohamed alleges that his wife was compelled to resign her teacher job and the
marriage fixed for his daughter was cancelled due to this criminal case. The petitioner Manoharan
alleges that his familly was viewed indifferently by the society, a stigma was cast upon them and they
were driven to leave their native place and the sufferings and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and 21496 of 2016 the penuries experienced by them cannot be described in
words.
16.All the available materials show that 6th respondent has conducted perfunctory investigation in
crmie No.90 of 2013, on account of which, the petitioners were falsely implicated in the case and
they were prisoned from 19.03.2013 to 25.07.2013 and 06.04.2013 to 25.07.2013 respectively.
17.It would be relevant to refer to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rudul
Sah vs State of Bihar, reported in AIR 1983 SC1086, wherein it has been held that one of the ways inV.N.Raja Mohamed vs The Secretary To The Government Of Tamil ... on 2 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186703360/ 8which the violation of the fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution by the authorities
of the State can reasonably be prevented is to direct payment of monetary compensation to the
individuals whose rights are affected. In para 10 it has been held as follows:
". . . . . . . .Article 21 which guarantees the right to life and liberty will be denuded of
its https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and 21496 of 2016
significant content if the power of this Court were limited to passing orders of release
from illegal detention. One of the telling ways in which the violation of that right can
reasonably be prevented and due compliance with the mandate of Art. 21 secured, is
to mulct its violators in the payment of monetary compensation. Administrative
sclerosis leading to flagrant infringements of fundamental rights cannot be corrected
by any other method open to the judiciary to adopt. The right to compensation is
some palliative for the unlawful acts of instrumentalities which act in the name of
public interest and which present for their protection the powers of the State as a
shield. If civilization is not to perish in this country as it has perished in some others
too well known to suffer mention, it is necessary to educate ourselves into accepting
that, respect for the rights of individuals is the true bastion of democracy. Therefore,
the State must repair the damage done by its officers to the petitioner's rights. It may
have recourse against those officers."
18.The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bhim Singh Vs State of Jammu and Kashmir and others, reported
in (1985) 4 SCC 677, has held as follows:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and 21496 of 2016 “ We can
only say that the Police officers acted in a most high handed way. We do not wish to
use stronger words to condemn the authoritarian acts of the Police. If the personal
liberty of a Member of the Legislative Assembly is to be played with in this fashion,
one can only wonder what may happen to lesser mortals. Police Officers who are the
custodians of law and order should have the greatest respect for the personal liberty
of citizens and should not flout the laws by stooping to such bizarre acts of
lawlessness. Custodians of law and order should not become depredators of civil
liberties. Their duty is to protect and not to abduct. We have no doubt that the
constitutional rights of Shri Bhim Singh were violated with impunity. Since he is now
not in detention, there is no need to make any order to set him at liberty, but suitably
and adequately compensated, he must be.
That we have the right to award monetary compensation by way of exemplary costs
or otherwise is now established by the decisions of this Court in Rudul Sah Vs State of
Bihar and Sebastian M. Hongray Vs Union of India. When a person comes to us with
the complaint that he has been arrested and imprisoned with mischevous or
malicious intent and that his constitutional and legal rights were invaded, the
mischief or malice and the invasion may not be washed away or wished away by his
being set https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and 21496 of 2016

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186703360/ 9awarding suitable monetary compensation. We consider this an appropriate case. We
direct the first respondent the State of Jammu and Kashmir to pay Shri Bhim Singh a
sum of Rs.50,000/- within two months from today. The amount will be deposited
with the Registrar of this Court and paid to Shri Bhim Singh.”
19.The Hon'ble Supreme Court in re S.Nambi Narayanan vs Siby Mathews & Others Etc, has held as
follows:
“31….The criminal law was set in motion without any basis. It was initiated, if one is
allowed to say, on some kind of fancy or notion. The liberty and dignity of the
appellant which are basic to his human rights were jeopardised as he was taken into
custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, he was compelled to face
cynical abhorrence. This situation invites the public law remedy for grant of
compensation for violation of the fundamental right envisaged under Article 21 of the
Constitution. In such a situation, it springs to life with immediacy. It is because life
commands self-respect and dignity.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P(MD)Nos.21495 and 21496 of 2016
20.In view of the above, this Court is of the view that the petitioners must be compensated suitably
for their false implication in the criminal case, infringment of fundamental rights and for the
consequential sufferings they have undergone and therefore, these writ petitions are allowed. The
Government shall pay a sum of Rs.10 Lakh [Rupees Ten lakh] to the petitioner VN.Rajamohamed
and Rs.8 Lakh [Rupees Eight Lakh] to petitioner M.Manoharan within a period of 16 [sixteen]
weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and the same shall be recovered from Ratna
Kumar, the Inspector of Police, District Crime Branch, Dharmapurti District. No costs.
