                                                     COMMON ORDER
The common questions that arise in this batch of Writ Petitions relates to the validity of Notification
No.II (1)/CTR/75 (b-2)/2007, dated 19.12.2007 (G.O.Ms.No.198) which is challenged on the
premise that the same is ultra vires Sections 30 and 88 of the Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act,
2006, (in short, ''the TNVAT Act''), apart from being unconstitutional and violative of Articles 14, 19
(1)
(g), 265, 301 and 304 (a) of the Constitution of India.
2. In all, there are 33 writ petitions though the prayers in all the 33 writ petitions are not the same,
however, the common issue revolves around the validity of the impugned notification. Broadly the
prayers can be categorised as under:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 3/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch WASTE
PAPER / WASTE PAPER BOARD S.No. Writ Petition No. Subject matter of

19.12.2007
3. Before proceeding further, it may be relevant to state that the counsel for the
petitioners and the Respondents submitted that in all the writ petitions common
question arises for consideration viz., whether it is open to the State Government in
exercise of its powers under Section 17 of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 4/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch (in short,
"TNGST Act") (or) Section 30 of the TNVAT Act, 2006, to impose conditions
retrospectively resulting in curtailing/whittling down exemptions granted. It wasM/S.Vg Paper And Boards Ltd vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 21 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133281943/ 2submitted that it may not be necessary to deal with each of the writ petitions
individually.
4. In all these cases other than W.P. Nos.6518 and 6519 of 2009, the petitioners were
engaged in manufacture of corrugated boxes. The petitioners purchased waste paper
from registered/unregistered dealers and used the same in the manufacture of
corrugated boxes/ boards. The period in dispute relates to the assessment years
2000-
2006. In W.P.Nos.6518 and 6519 of 2009, the petitioners purchased used/old bottles, except for the
difference in the product the question raised in the above writ petitions also revolves around the
scope and ambit of the power of the State Government to impose conditions retrospectively thereby
curtailing / whittling down the scope of the exemption. It is relevant to state that the notifications
for waste paper, paper board and used/old bottles granting exemption and the subsequent
notification importing conditions retrospectively are identically worded and part of the same
notification.
5. Section 3 of the TNGST Act, is the charging provision. Sub-section (2) to Section 3 of the TNVAT
Act, 2006, prescribes the rate of tax and the point of levy in respect of goods mentioned in the First
Schedule to the TNGST Act. During the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 5/26

@ 4% at the point of “Last Purchase” from 1.6.2000 to 18.8.2001 and 28.8.2001 respectively. While
old/ used bottles were liable to tax under Serial No.24 of Part-DD and Entry 90 of Part B of the First
Schedule to the TNGST Act during 1.4.2000 to 31.5.2000 and 1.6.2000 to 31.3.2006. The relevant
Entries in the Schedule to the TNGST Act, 1959, with regard to Waste Paper reads as under:

6. Section 17 of the TNGST Act, 1959, empowers the State Government to grant
exemption/concession in rate of tax by notification on any goods, transactions, or dealers in the
entire State or part of it, subject to any restrictions or conditions that may be specified in the

2. The exemption hereby made shall be deemed to have come into force on the 1st June 2000 and

A reading of the above notification(s) would show that the same are issued under Section 30 of the
TNVAT Act, 2006, read with sub-Section (4) to Section 88 of the TNVAT Act, 2006, importing the
condition that the benefit of exemption would be available subject to the condition that the goods
purchased viz., waste paper, paper board and old or used bottles are sold by way of interstate sale
and taxes due thereon is paid.
It is this notification which is under challenge in the present batch of writ petitions, on the premise
that the same is ultra vires Section 30 and Section 88 of the TNVAT Act, apart from being
unconstitutional and violative of Articles 14, 19 (1) (g), 265, 301 and 304 (a) of the Constitution of
India, insofar as it imports conditions with retrospective effect which has the effect of
curtailing/whittling down the exemption.
7. To appreciate the above contention, it is relevant to refer to the following provisions under the
TNGST Act and TNVAT Act respectively:
''Section 17. Power of Government to notify exemptions and reductions of tax.- (1)
The Government may, by notification, issued whether prospectively or
retrospectively, make an exemption, or reduction in rate, in respect of any tax
payable under this Act -
(i) on the sale or purchase of any specified goods or class of goods, at all points or at a
specified point or points in the series of sales by successive
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 10/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch dealers; or
(ii) by any specified class of persons, in regard to the whole or any part of their
turnover; or
(iii) on the sale or purchase of any specified classes of goods by specified classes of
dealers in regard to the whole or part of their turnover.
.........M/S.Vg Paper And Boards Ltd vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 21 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133281943/ 6Sec.17(3) The Government may, by notification, cancel or vary any notification issued under
sub-section (1).
.......'' Section 30 of the TNVAT Act :
''Section 30. Power of Government to notify exemption or reduction of tax.
(1) The Government may, by notification, whether prospectively or retrospectively,
make an exemption, or reduction in rate, in respect of any tax payable under this Act
(a) on the sale or purchase of any specified goods or class of goods, at all points or at
a specified point or points In the series of sales by successive dealers;.or
(b) by any specified class of persons, in regard to the whole or any part of their
turnover; or
(c) on the sale or purchase of any specified classes of goods by specified classes of
dealers in regard to the whole or part of their turnover.
(2) Any exemption from tax, or reduction in the rate of tax, notified under
sub-section (1)-
(a) may extend to the whole State or to any specified area or areas therein; or
(b) may be subject to such restrictions and conditions as may be specified in the
notification.
(3) The Government may, by notification, cancel or vary any notification issued
under sub-section (1).'' Section 88 (4) of the TNVAT Act :
''88 (4)- All arrears of tax, interest, penalty, fee or other amount due under the said
Act or 1970 Act, as the case may be, on the date of commencement of this Act,
whether assessed or levied before such commencement, or assessed or levied after
such commencement, may be recovered as if such tax, penalty, interest, fee or other
amount is assessed or levied under the provisions of this Act and all methods of
recovery including levy of penalty, interest or prosecution provided under this Act,
shall apply to such https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 11/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 &
Batch arrears, as if such amounts are assessed, levied and dernanded under this Act.''
A reading of Section 17 and Section 30 of the TNGST Act and TNVAT Act respectively
would show that while the State Government is conferred with the power to notify the
exemption prospectively or retrospectively, the power to modify or vary or cancel can
be done only prospectively and not retrospectively.M/S.Vg Paper And Boards Ltd vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 21 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133281943/ 78. It is the case of the assessees/petitioners that the impugned notification insofar as it has
introduced a condition retrospectively resulting in curtailing/ whittling down the scope of
exemption is beyond the powers under Section 17 (or) Section 30 read with Section 88 (4) of the
TNGST Act and TNVAT Act respectively.
9. In support of the above contention, reliance was sought to be placed on the judgments of this
Court in Honest Corporation v. State of Tamil Nadu, [(1999) 113 STC 26 (Mad.)], and State of Tamil
Nadu v. Kannapiran Steel Re-rolling Mills, [(1999) 112 STC 161 (Mad.)], wherein, while dealing with
Section 17 of the TNGST Act, it was held that the power of the Government under Sub-section (3) to
Section 17 of the TNGST Act, 1959, cannot be exercised retrospectively.
10. To the contrary, it is submitted by the learned Additional Advocate General that it was always
intended that the benefit is only to grant either an exemption to waste
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 12/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch paper, paper board and old
or used bottles from the levy of last purchase or from the levy of the Central Sales Tax but not both.
The original notification dated 28.12.2006 resulted in exemption from last purchase as well as levy
under the Central Sales Tax, which was unintended. It was to rectify the above error, which
according to the State had inadvertently crept in, while issuing the first Notification dated
28.12.2006, notification dated 19.12.2007 was issued, importing the above condition. It was thus
submitted that the case of retrospectivity that has been put across by the petitioners ought to be
viewed bearing in mind the context of the present case. It is also the contention of the learned
Additional Advocate General that the issue of refund if any ought to be examined by applying the
“Doctrine of Unjust Enrichment”.
11. Heard both sides. Perused the materials on record.
12. Two questions arise for consideration in these batch of cases viz., (1) Whether the impugned
notification(s) which imports the condition that the exemption to Waste Paper, Paper Boards and
used/old bottles shall be subject to the concession that the said goods are sold on inter-state trade
and tax has been paid under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, retrospectively is within or beyond the
scope of the powers conferred on the Government in terms of Section 17 of the TNGST Act, 1959 (or)
Section 30 read with Section 88 (4) of the TNVAT Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 13/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch (2) Whether any refund
consequent to a declaration that the impugned notifications are ultra vires would be subject to the
doctrine of ''Unjust Enrichment''.
13. We shall now proceed to answer the above questions in seriatim.
14. The first question is no longer res integra. Power may be conferred to make subordinate/
delegated legislation in the shape of rules, bye-laws, notifications etc., which have retrospective
operation. 1 Such a power may be either conferred in express words or may be inferred by necessary
implication.2 In the absence, however, of an express or necessarily implied power to that effect,
subordinate/ delegated legislation, be it a rule, a bye-law or a notification, cannot have retrospectiveM/S.Vg Paper And Boards Ltd vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 21 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133281943/ 8operation.3
15. It has been consistently held by this Court in the context of Section 17 of TNGST Act which is pari
materia with Section 30 of the TNVAT Act, that while the Government is conferred with the power
to grant exemption prospectively or retrospectively, the power to withdraw, annul, modify or vary a
notifcation traceable to sub-Section (3) to Section 17 of the TNGST Act, cannot be exercised
retrospectively. In this regard, it is relevant to refer to the following judgments :
1 Prohibition & Excise Supdt., A.P. v. Toddy Tappers Coop. Society, (2003) 12 SCC
738 2 Indramani Pyarelal Gupta (Dr.) v. W.R. Natu, (1963) 1 SCR 721 3 ITO v. M.C.
Ponnoose, (1969) 2 SCC 351 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 14/26
W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch
(i) Honest Corporation v. State of Tamil Nadu (Mad.), (1999) 113 STC 26 (Mad) :
12. If we carefully peruse, the language in which sub-section (1) of section 17 is
couched, it will be crystal clear that as and when the Government may, by
notification, make an exemption or reduction in rate in respect of any tax payable
under the Act, the same may be done whether prospectively or retrospectively.
But, if we take into account the language in which sub-section (3) of section 17 is couched, the
phraseology whether prospectively or retrospectively is not there and what is stated therein is the
Government is empowered by way of a notification to cancel or vary any notification issued under
sub-section (1). That means that notification issued under the said sub-section can be only
prospectively and not retrospectively.
ii) G. Packirisamy & Co. v. State of Tamil Nadu [1995] 99 STC 21:
“By the enactment of sub-section (1) of section 17 of the TNGST Act the Legislature
has given power to the Government to make subordinate legislation, by way of
issuance of a notification to grant exemption or reduction of tax, either prospectively
or retrospectively. No doubt true it is that under sub-section (3) thereof, the
Government inheres power to cancel or vary any notification issued under
sub-section (1) by the issuance of another notification. But the language of the said
sub-section, if subjected to careful scrutiny, will reveal such a power is not taking in
its fold the power to cancel or vary any notification with retrospective effect and to
put it otherwise, such a power may be exercised only prospectively.” (emphasis

(iii) In the case of State of Tamil Nadu v. Kannapiran Steel Re-rolling Mills, (1999)
112 STC 161 (Mad.) while considering similar provisions under Section 8(5) of the
CST Act, 1956, this Court was pleased to hold as under:M/S.Vg Paper And Boards Ltd vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 21 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133281943/ 9"21....There is no provision in the Act which confers power on the State Government
to issue a notification under section 8-A with retrospective effect. It is beyond dispute
that a competent Legislature may make a law even on matters relating to taxation
with retrospective effect. The question, however, is whether the executive authority,
to which the power to modify a law as delegated by a Legislature under a statute, can
withdraw a benefit already given in the absence of an express provision in the statute
itself, enabling it to exercise that power with retrospective effect. The question is no
longer res integra. In India Sugars and Refineries Ltd. v. State of Mysore AIR 1960
Mys. 326, the question which https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 15/26
W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch arose for consideration was whether the power
conferred by a Legislature on a subordinate legislative body like Government to issue
notification having the force of law under a statute could be exercised retrospectively
unless the power to issue such a notification with retrospective effect had been
conferred expressly by the statute itself. This Court, relying upon the decision of the
Supreme Court in Strawboard Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Gutta Mill Workers' Union
AIR 1953 SC 95, held that in the absence of a legislative provision conferring power to
issue a notification retrospectively, it was not open to the State Government to issue
such a notification.
Income-tax Officer, Alleppey v. M.C. Ponnoose [1967] 64 ITR 117 (Ker); AIR 1966 Ker
5, following the decision of this Court in India Sugars and Refineries Ltd. AIR 1960
Mys 326 and the decision of the Supreme Court in Indramani's case AIR 1963 SC
274, the Kerala High Court held :
"unless the power to act retrospectively had been expressly conferred by the
Legislature on the Government exercising subordinate and delegated legislative
powers, the Government could not act retrospectively. No decision which takes a
contrary view has been cited before us. We are of the opinion that in the absence of
express power granted by the Legislature to act retrospectively it is not open to a
subordinate legislative body like the State Government to issue a notification either
taking away vested rights or imposing obligations with retrospective effect."
(emphasis supplied)
iv) Cannanore Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd. v. Collector of Customs and Central Excise AIR 1970
SC 1950:
"..............The rule-making authority had not been vested with the power under the
Central Excises and Salt Act to make rules with retrospective effect. Therefore the
retrospective effect purported to be given under exhibit P12 was beyond the power of
the rule-making authority......"
On a reading of the above judgments it is beyond the pale of any doubt that the power of the State
Government be it under Sub-section (3) to Section 17 or 30 of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisM/S.Vg Paper And Boards Ltd vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 21 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133281943/ 1016/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch TNGST Act or TNVAT Act respectively cannot modify, annul or
vary a notification retrospectively. Thus the impugned notification insofar as it imports conditions
which curtails or whittles the exemption for waste paper, paper board and old or used bottles is in
excess of the power conferred under Sub-section (3) to Section 17 or 30 of the TNGST Act or TNVAT
Act respectively.
16. Now, insofar as the submission of the learned Advocate General that the exemption granted vide
G.O.Ms. No.176 dated 28.12.2006, without any condition attached was due to inadvertence
inasmuch as the intention was only to grant exemption either under TNGST Act or Central Sales Tax
Act, 1956 (in short, "CST Act"). However, the notification dated 28.12.2006 resulted in taxes not
being payable both under TNGST Act as well as CST Act, contrary to the intention. Thereby
necessitating issuance of the subsequent notification dated 19.12.2017 importing the condition that
the exemption would be subject to the condition that the goods are sold on inter-state trade and tax
paid under the CST Act, with retrospective effect from 28.12.2006 to cure the above defect alleged to
have inadvertently crept in. In other words the above circumstance is sought to be relied upon to
justify the retrospective exercise of power. The above submission needs to be rejected for two
reasons:
1. Firstly, as we have seen from the judgments referred to supra, the power be it
under Section 17 or 30 of the TNGST/ TNVAT Act, respectively is not available to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 17/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch withdraw/
import conditions with regard to exemptions/ concessional rate of tax
retrospectively. In the absence of power to vary a notification retrospectively it may
not be open to the State Government to assume such power on the basis of
circumstances viz., the supposed legislative intent/ object having not been reflected
appropriately when the power was initially exercised. In other words, the State
Government's limitation or lack of power to issue notifications varying/curtailing
notifications retrospectively under Section 17 and 30 of TNGST and TNVAT Act,
respectively is not in view of the circumstance but rather due to absence of such
power being conferred by the legislature. The extent, scope or width of the power
would not vary depending on the circumstance as sought to be contended by the
Revenue.
2. Secondly, it is trite law that the notifications granting exemption would be strictly
construed and effect would be given to the plain language and the question of
interpretation would not arise where the language is unambiguous. In the case on
hand, admittedly there was no ambiguity as to the scope and width of the notification
granting exemption vide G.O.Ms.No.176 dated 28.12.2006. The impugned
notification even according to the Revenue was issued only with a view to curtail the
scope of the exemption as it did not reflect the supposed intent of the notifying
authority viz., the State Government. What the legislature intended to be done or not
to be done can only be ascertained from that it has chosen to enact and when the
language is unambiguous looking beyond the plain language ought to be avoided.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133281943/ 11W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch intention to curtail the notification for intention is a
slippery phrase. In this regard, it may be relevant to refer to the following judgments
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court:
a) In the case of Innamuri Gopalan v. State of A.P., (1964) 2 SCR 888, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court while examining an exemption granted to Textiles rejected the plea
by the State to curtail the scope of exemption on the premise that exemption from
payment of Sales Tax was granted in order to avoid double taxation of levy of excise
duty by the Central Government and sales tax by the State Government. That the
intention was clear from the condition imposed requiring the claimant of the
exemption to prove that additional duties of excise have been paid to claim the
benefit of exemption on sales tax. It was submitted that admittedly, no additional
duty of excise was leviable on the goods in the possession of the appellants and thus
the condition of proving that additional duties of excise have been paid to claim the
benefit of exemption does not arise. It was submitted that the exemption being
granted only with a view to avoid double taxation viz., of the liability to pay excise
duty as well as sales tax and that the assessee not being bound to pay additional
excise duty cannot claim the benefit of exemption on sales tax as such construction of
the exemption notification was contrary to the intention. Rejecting the above
contention, it was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:
“No doubt, statutes have to be construed as a whole so as to avoid any inconsistency
or repugnancy among its several provisions, but if there is nothing to modify, nothing
to alter, or nothing to qualify the language of a statute, the words and sentences have
to be construed in their ordinary and natural meaning. What we are now
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 19/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch concerned
with is a fiscal provision and it has often been said that there is no equity in a taxing
statute and either the subject is within it or not, on the words of the enactment or the
rules validly made thereunder. In a taxing statute there is no room for any
intendment but regard must be had to the clear meaning of the words. The entire
matter is governed wholly by the words of the provision. If the taxpayer is within the
plain terms of the exemption he cannot be denied its benefit by calling in aid any
supposed intention of the exempting authority. If such intention can be gathered
from the construction of the words of the statute or rule or by necessary implication
therefrom, the matter is different”. In this connection we may refer to the
observations of Lord Watson in Salomon v. Salomon & Co. [(1897) AC 22, 38] :
“Intention of the legislature is a common but very slippery phrase, which, popularly
understood may signify anything from intention embodied in positive enactment to
speculative opinion as to what the legislature probably would have meant, although
there has been an omission to enact it. In a Court of Law or Equity, what the
Legislature intended to be done or not to be done can only be legitimately ascertained
from that which it has chosen to enact, either in express words or by reasonable and
necessary implication.” b. In, Hansraj Gordhandas v. H.H. Dave, (1969) 2 SCR 253,M/S.Vg Paper And Boards Ltd vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 21 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133281943/ 12the Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing with a notification which granted
exemption from excise duty to cotton fabrics produced on power looms owned by
Co-operative Societies, it was found for a fact that the appellant who was a dealer in
textiles had entered into an agreement with Co-operative Society to manufacture
cotton fabrics. The Society claimed exemption. The Revenue was of the view that the
Society was not entitled to exemption as in its view the intention was to grant
exemption to goods produced by the Society “for itself”. The same was rejected
stating that the language being clear the attempt to add conditions on the basis of an
assumed intent was not justified. In this regard, it may be relevant to refer to the
following portions of the judgment:
“It was contended on behalf of the appellant that under the contract between the
appellant and the society there was no relationship of master and servant but. the
appellant supplied raw material and the contractor i.e. the Society produced the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 20/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch goods. But
even on the assumption that the appellant had manufactured the goods by employing
hired labour and was therefore a manufacturer, still the appellant was entitled to
exemption from excise duty since the case fell within the language of the two
notifications dated July 31, 1959 and April 30, 1960, and the cotton fabrics were
produced on power-looms owned by the cooperative society and there is nothing in
the notifications to suggest that the cotton fabrics should be produced by the
Cooperative Society “for itself” and not for a third party before it was entitled to claim
exemption from excise duty. It was contended on behalf of the respondent that the
object of granting exemption was to encourage the formation of cooperative societies
which not only produced cotton fabrics but which also consisted of members, not
only owning but having actually operated not more than four power-looms during the
three years immediately preceding their having joined the society. The policy was
that instead of each such member operating his looms on his own, he should combine
with others by forming a society which, through the cooperative effort should
produce cloth. The intention was that the goods produced for which exemption could
be claimed must be goods produced on its own behalf by the society. We are unable
to accept the contention put forward on behalf of the respondents as correct. On a
true construction of the language of the notifications, dated July 31, 1959 and April
30, 1960 it is clear that all that is required for claiming exemption is that the cotton
fabrics must be produced on power-looms owned by the cooperative society. There is
no further requirement under the two notifications that the cotton fabrics must be
produced by the Co-operative Society on the powerlooms “for itself”. It is well
established that in a taxing statute there is no room for any intendment but regard
must be had to the clear meaning of the words. The entire matter is governed wholly
by the language of the notification. If the tax-payer is within the plain terms of the
exemption it cannot be denied its benefit by calling in aid any supposed intention of
the exempting authority. If such intention can be gathered from the construction of
the words of the notification or by necessary implication therefrom, the matter is
different, but that is not the case here.” The above ratio laid down in Hansraj caseM/S.Vg Paper And Boards Ltd vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 21 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133281943/ 13was followed by a Constitution Bench in the case of CCE v. Hari Chand Shri Gopal,
(2011) 1 SCC 236, and stands reiterated by a recent Constitution Bench in the case of
Commissioner of Customs v. Dilip Kumar & Co., (2018) 9 SCC 1, wherein it was held
as under:
"In Hansarj case, the Constitutional Bench unanimously pointed out that an
exemption from taxation is to be allowed based wholly by the language of the
notification and exemption cannot be gathered by necessary implication or by
construction of words; in other words, one has to look to the language alone and the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 21/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch object and
purpose for granting exemption is irrelevant and immaterial."
17. We are therefore of the view that though exemption notifications ought to be strictly construed
and in the event of any ambiguity it must be interpreted in favour of the Revenue, however one
cannot curtail or add words by calling in aid the intent of grant of exemption nor can the
government aid the authority granting notification or the Legislature in the event of a defective
phrasing by adding or mending and thereby making up deficiencies with a view to further supposed
intention. The submissions of the revenue on the basis of supposed intention in granting exemption
deserves to be rejected.
18. In view of the repeal of TNGST Act, 1959 and introduction of TNVAT Act, 2006, doubts were
expressed if the impugned notification is traceable to Section 17 of TNGST Act or Section 30 of the
TNVAT Act. It is clear that the power whether traceable to sub-Section (3) to Section 30 or
sub-Section (3) to Section 17 of the TNVAT Act or TNGST Act, respectively cannot be exercised to
withdraw or import a condition and impose a disqualification or ineligibility retrospectively as
would be clear from the above discussion.
19. We have no hesitation in holding that the impugned notification travels
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 22/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch beyond the scope of power
conferred under sub-Section (3) to Section 17 (or) Section 30 of the TNGST Act and the TNVAT Act
respectively and thus the impugned notification viz., Notification No.II (1)/CTR/75 (b-2)/2007,
dated 19.12.2007 (G.O.Ms.No.198) is ultra vires to Sections 17 of the TNGST Act, 1959 (or) Sections
30 and 88 of the TNVAT Act, 2006, insofar as it imports conditions with retrospective effect which
has the effect of curtailing/ whittling down the scope of exemption granted vide notification in
G.O.Ms.No.176 dated 28.12.2006.
20. It was submitted that in view of Section 88(2)(i) of the TNGST Act , the saving is only in respect
of notifications, which continued to be in force on or before the introduction of the TNVAT Act.
However, the original notification dated 28.12.2006, had a limited operation and for a temporary
period, which has expired long before the impugned notification importing the additional
condition/ obligation was issued. The impugned notification is bad for the said reason as well. We
are not inclined to examine the above question in view of the fact that we have already held that the
impugned notification is ultra vires the power under Section 17(3) (or) Section 30(3) of the TNGST
Act and the TNVAT Act respectively.M/S.Vg Paper And Boards Ltd vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 21 December, 2022

W.P.No.6519 of 2009, it was submitted by the learned counsel https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
23/26 W.P.Nos.36170/2007 & Batch for the petitioners in the other matters that as and when a
claim for refund is made, if the Assessing Officers choose to examine the claim applying the
principle of "Unjust Enrichment", they would respond/ meet the said aspect.
22. However, in W.P.No.6518 of 2009, it was submitted that it was not a case of claim of refund, but
a case where the assessment orders were made granting refund and the prayer is to direct the 1st
Respondent herein to forbear from giving effect to or rely upon Notification
No.II(1)/CTR/75/(81)/07 [G.O.Ms.No.198, Commercial Taxes and Registration (B2)] dated
19.12.2007, to revise or review completed proceedings granting exemption in respect of the
purchases of old/ used empty bottles during the period from 1st June, 2000 to 5th September,
2006. It is submitted by the learned counsel that Doctrine of Unjust Enrichment is applicable only
against a claim for refund and not to reopen closed assessment thereby resulting in recovery of any
sums/amounts collected by way of or purporting to be by way of tax. We are not inclined to accede
to the above prayer for we do not intend rather cannot pass orders pre-empting a quasi- judicial
authority from exercising its power. We intend to make it clear that the above declaration on the
validity of the impugned notification would not preclude the authorities to recover the sums if any
collected by way or purporting to be by way of taxes if law enables/permits to do so. Needless to
state that any such exercise shall be in accordance with law.
