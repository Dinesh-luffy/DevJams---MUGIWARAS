This common order will now dispose of captioned main writ petition and captioned 'Writ
Miscellaneous Petition' ['WMP'] thereat.
2. Mr.B.Raveendran, learned counsel for writ petitioner and Mr.T.N.C.Kaushik, learned
Government Advocate (Taxes) on behalf of both the respondents are before this Court.
3. It is deemed appropriate to say that this order shall be read in conjunction with and in
continuation of earlier proceedings made in the previous listings on 09.12.2022 and 12.12.2022,
which read as follows:
'Proceedings made on 09.12.2022 Captioned writ petition was in the Admission
Board on 07.12.2022, it was re-notified for being taken up on 08.12.2022, it was
listed in the Admission Board on 08.12.2022, Mr.B.Raveendran, learned counsel on
record for writ petitioner started making submissions in the presence of
Mr.T.N.C.Kaushik, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis learned Additional Government
Pleader (Taxes) and the matter was kept in the Admission Board for further hearing
today.
2. To be noted, captioned writ petition has been filed assailing 'proceedings dated
02.12.2022, bearing reference GDN No.4554/22-23/OR No.4554/22-23' [hereinafter
'impugned proceedings' for the sake of brevity, convenience and clarity] made by the
respondent.
3. The impugned proceedings have been made under Section 129(3) of 'The Central
Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017' [hereinafter 'C-G&ST Act' for the sake of brevity,
convenience and clarity] read with 'The State/Union Territory Goods and Services
Tax Act, 2017' [hereinafter 'State/Union Territory G & ST Act' for the sake of
convenience and Clarity] besides Section 20 of 'Integrated Goods and Services Tax
Act, 2017' [hereinafter 'Integrated G & T Act' for convenience].
4. Short facts are that a truck bearing Registration No.TN28-AQ-9203 which was
carrying a consignment described as 'Angles' from Gummidipoondi to Ranipet was
intercepted in the wee hours i.e., at about 04.00 am at Walaja toll. After interception,Tvl.Thiruvannamalaiyar Transport vs The Deputy State Tax Officer on 13 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163953934/ 2the impugned proceedings came to be made detaining the truck with the
consignment. The only ground on which the impugned proceedings have been made
is that e-way bill had expired.
5. Adverting to 'Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017' [hereinafter 'said Rules' for the
sake of convenience] being substantive legislation under C-G & ST Act, learned
counsel for writ petitioner pointed out that Rule 138 and more particularly,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Rule 138(10), the second and third provisos thereat
provide for extension of validity of period of e-way bill within 8 hours from the time
of expiry. Learned counsel for writ petitioner submitted that the validity of the e-way
bill qua aforementioned consignment elapsed at 23:59 hours on 01.12.2022 and at
the time of interception, 8 hours therefrom had not elapsed (4 hours was left).
6. Learned counsel for writ petitioner submitted that on interception and detention,
the portal was blocked and therefore, the extension of e-way bill could not be done
though the writ petitioner had a good four hours from the time of detention.
7. Learned Revenue counsel brought to the notice of this Court an order dated
25.08.2022 made in W.P.Nos.18753 of 2022 and etc., batch and submitted that in
cases of this nature, the owner of the consignment should come before the writ Court
and not the transporter. On a perusal of the order, it comes to light that 25.08.2022
order made by a Hon'ble single Judge pertains to cases where the goods transported
were not accompanied by documents, the documents accompanying the consignment
were deficient and in another case there were alleged discrepancies in the e-way bill /
documents and therefore this 25.08.2022 order made in TCI Freight Vs. The
Assistant Commissioner and another is distinguishable on facts qua factual matrix of
case on hand. In this regard, this Court deems it appropriate to remind itself of the
celebrated Padma Sundara Rao case law [Padma Sundara Rao Vs. State of Tamil
Nadu reported in (2002) 3 SCC 533], more particularly paragraph 9 thereat, which
reads as follows:
'9.Courts should not place reliance on decisions without
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis discussing as to how the factual situation fits in
with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed. There is always
peril in treating the words of a speech or judgment as though they are words in a
legislative enactment, and it is to be remembered that judicial utterances are made in
the setting of the facts of a particular case, said Lord Morris in Herrington v. British
Railways Board [(1972) 2 WLR 537 : 1972 AC 877 (HL) [Sub nom British Railways
Board v. Herrington, (1972) 1 All ER 749 (HL)]] . Circumstantial flexibility, one
additional or different fact may make a world of difference between conclusions in
two cases.' To be note d, Padma Sundara Rao case was rendered by Hon'ble
Constitution Bench and therefore is not just a ratio but declaration of law by Hon'ble
Supreme Court.Tvl.Thiruvannamalaiyar Transport vs The Deputy State Tax Officer on 13 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163953934/ 38. Today, learned Revenue counsel submits that the respondent is the proper Officer
qua the aforesaid proceedings and it passed an order yesterday for payment of
penalty of Rs.6,76,764/-.
9. In the normal circumstances, the sequitur would have been the writ petition would
have become infructuous but the order came to be made when the writ petition was
being actively heard by this Court. However, to be fair to the respondent it should be
recorded that Section 129(3) prescribes a time line of seven days from the date of
service of notice specifying the penalty payable.
Such notice was served on writ petitioner on 02.12.2022 and therefore, the order came to be made
yesterday.
10. As a one off case, considering the peculiar facts and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
circumstances of the instant case and the trajectory the hearing has taken, making it clear that this
order will not serve as a precedent, writ petitioner is permitted to move an amendment application
inter-alia to assail 08.12.2022 order made by the respondent.

4. The aforementioned proceedings are tell-tale. The proceedings also capture the trajectory the
matter has taken thus far.
5. Aforementioned proceedings shall be read as an integral part and parcel of this order and
therefore short forms and abbreviations used in the earlier proceedings shall continue to be used in
the instant order also.
6. As facts have already been captured in 09.12.2022 proceedings, it is not necessary to dilate on the
same again.
7. It emerges from submissions that only two points arise for consideration and they are:
a) break down of the truck carrying consignment, repair and consequent delay;
b) portal being blocked without access to renew E-way bill though four more hours to
do so was available at the time of interception of truck.
8. To be noted, post amendment 'order dated 08.12.2022 bearing reference GDN No.4554/22-23
made by the second respondent' [hereinafter 'present impugned order' for the sake of convenience
and clarity] is also under challenge.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
9. Present impugned order proceeds on the basis that both the above said points do not find favour
with the second respondent. As regards the first point, it is stated that driver of the truck carrying
the consignment did not mention about breakdown and repair. As regards the second point, thoughTvl.Thiruvannamalaiyar Transport vs The Deputy State Tax Officer on 13 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163953934/ 6there is no mention about portal being blocked, it has been mentioned that no steps have been taken
for extending the E-
way bill.
10. A careful perusal of the facts and circumstances of the case, leaves this Court with no doubt that
there would have been no revenue loss to the respondent / State if the truck had reached the
destination without being intercepted.
11. Attention of this Court is drawn to a 'circular dated 31.05.2019 being Circular
No.10/2019,Q1/17253/2019' [hereinafter 'said circular' for the sake of brevity, convenience and
clarity] which pertains to enforcement of G & ST and what has been described as 'a new approach' to
be followed with effect from 01.06.2019.
12. Paragraph 10 of the said circular is relevant for case on hand and the same reads as follows:
'10.CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE PENALTY UPTO Rs.5000/- PER ACT SHALL BE
LEVIED:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Where the movement of goods is accompanied by
any one of the basic documents such as invoice or bill of supply or delivery challan or
E-way bill as prescribed in Rule 55 A and 138 A of the TNGST Rules 2018, and in
such cases where at least one of the basic documents, manifestly showing sufferance
of tax in the particular transaction is available, a penalty of upto Rs.5000/- per act
shall be levied so as to deter the recurrence of offence. The following are examples in
this context:
Example 1: Vehicles meant for a vehicle distributor are delivered at the stock yard/
godown/ branch; the transporter possesses the necessary tax invoice, but the E-way
bill was generated for principal place of business/different place of business.
In this case the CGST /SGST /IGST (if interstate supply) would have been suffered at
the hands of manufacturer or distributor. Mere delivery of the goods at a place other
than those mentioned in the documents would not render the transaction as an
evasion or abetment of evasion. Being a B 2 B transaction, trail of transaction would
now be available in GSTR1 for the department.
Example 2: A conveyance carrying the goods from a factory of fertilizers is delivering
the same at various locations as directed by the department of Agriculture. The goods
are accompanied by invoice or invoice with delivery challan and E- way bill. The
E-way bill has expired due to delay in making delivery at various locations. The
expiry of E-way bill does not create any scope for evasion. In cases as in the examples,
penalty of upto Rs.5000/- per Act shall be levied.' https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisTvl.Thiruvannamalaiyar Transport vs The Deputy State Tax Officer on 13 December, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163953934/ 713. In the instant case, from the narrative thus far, it comes closest to Example 2. It is reiterated and
clearly articulated in Example 2 that the expiry of E-way bill does not create any scope for evasion.
Absent evasion, there can be no revenue loss. It has been made clear that in cases of such nature
penalty upto Rs.5,000/- per act shall be levied.
This may have to be read with Section 125 of C-G & ST Act, which is residuary in nature qua
penalties which do not find a place in the adumbration of (xxi) categories in sub-section (1) of
Section 122.
14. In the light of the narrative, discussion and dispositive reasoning thus far, on a demurrer,
assuming there was no breakdown and assuming the portal was active, the maximum penalty would
be Rs.5,000/- qua paragraph 10 of said Circular and therefore as a sequitur, the following order is
passed:
(i) The present impugned order dated 08.12.2022 bearing reference GDN
No.4554/2022-23 made by the second respondent is set aside;
(ii) The impugned proceedings dated 02.12.2022 is set aside albeit with a directive
that the writ petitioner shall pay a penalty of Rs.5,000/- (Rupees Five Thousand
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis only) as per paragraph 10 of said Circular dated
31.05.2019 latest by tomorrow;
(iii) On payment of penalty in the aforesaid manner latest by tomorrow, the second
respondent shall release the truck bearing Registration No.TN28-AQ-9203 forthwith
with the consignment.
15. It is made clear that this order has been made owing to the peculiar trajectory the writ petition
took in the Admission Board and therefore, this order shall not serve as a precedent in all matters of
interception, detention and penalty. In other words, such matters will have to be dealt with on a case
to case basis on the facts and circumstances and merits of respective cases (including alternate
remedy point).
Captioned writ petition and WMP disposed of with the above directives. There shall be no order as
to costs.
